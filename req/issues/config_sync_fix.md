# BLE Configuration Sync Fix

## Issue
When the app was not connected to BLE and the user saved configuration in Settings, the configuration was saved locally but not synced to the device when BLE reconnected. The app showed a notification "Settings saved locally. Connect to device to sync." but the sync never happened upon connection.

## Root Cause
The BLE connection handler in `home_screen.dart` only started location tracking when connected but did not check for and sync any saved configuration from SharedPreferences.

## Solution
Added automatic configuration sync on BLE connection:

1. Created `_syncSavedConfiguration()` method in `home_screen.dart` that:
   - Loads saved configuration from SharedPreferences
   - Waits 1 second for connection to stabilize
   - Sends configuration to device via BLE
   - Shows success/failure notification

2. Modified connection state listener to call `_syncSavedConfiguration()` when BLE state changes to connected

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified:
- `/lib/screens/home_screen.dart`
  - Added SharedPreferences import
  - Added `_syncSavedConfiguration()` method
  - Modified connection state listener to sync config on connect

### Code Flow:
1. User saves configuration in Settings screen while BLE disconnected
2. Configuration is saved to SharedPreferences
3. When BLE connects, the connection state listener detects the change
4. `_syncSavedConfiguration()` is automatically called
5. Saved config is loaded from SharedPreferences and sent to device
6. User sees success notification when sync completes

## Testing
To test the fix:
1. Disconnect from BLE device
2. Go to Settings and configure phone number and interval
3. Save configuration (will save locally)
4. Connect to BLE device
5. Configuration should automatically sync and show success notification

## Status
âœ… Fixed - Configuration now automatically syncs when BLE connects
