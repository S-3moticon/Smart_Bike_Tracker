# Bluetooth State Monitoring and Auto-Sync Fix

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Bluetooth State Not Monitored
**Problem:** App didn't detect when user forgot to turn on Bluetooth after granting permissions. Users would see empty scan results without understanding why.

**Solution:** Added real-time Bluetooth adapter state monitoring that:
- Shows prominent error card when Bluetooth is off
- Displays dialog prompting user to enable Bluetooth
- Automatically starts scanning when Bluetooth is turned on
- Stops scanning and clears device list when Bluetooth is turned off

### 2. Configuration Not Syncing from Scan Page
**Problem:** When user saved configuration while disconnected, it wasn't syncing when connecting from the scanning page.

**Solution:** Configuration sync is now triggered automatically when BLE connection succeeds:
- Connection state listener calls `_syncSavedConfiguration()` on connect
- Works for both auto-connect and manual connection from scan list
- Shows success/failure notifications to user

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified

#### `/lib/services/bluetooth_service.dart`
- Added `_bluetoothStateController` stream for Bluetooth state changes
- Added `initializeBluetoothMonitoring()` method to start adapter monitoring
- Added `getCurrentBluetoothState()` to get initial state
- Added `bluetoothState` stream getter for UI to subscribe
- Updated `dispose()` to clean up new subscriptions

#### `/lib/screens/home_screen.dart`  
- Added `_bluetoothStateSubscription` to monitor Bluetooth state
- Added `_bluetoothState` property to track current state
- Added `_showBluetoothOffDialog()` to prompt user to enable Bluetooth
- Modified `_initializeApp()` to check initial Bluetooth state
- Added Bluetooth state listener in `_setupListeners()`
- Updated `_buildConnectionStatus()` to show Bluetooth off warning card
- Added "Enable" button that calls `FlutterBluePlus.turnOn()`

## User Experience Flow

### When Bluetooth is Off:
1. App detects Bluetooth is off on startup or when turned off
2. Shows red warning card with "Bluetooth is Off" message
3. Displays dialog prompting to enable Bluetooth
4. Provides "Enable" button to turn on Bluetooth
5. Automatically starts scanning when Bluetooth is enabled

### Configuration Sync:
1. User saves configuration while disconnected
2. Configuration stored in SharedPreferences
3. User connects to device (auto or manual)
4. App automatically loads saved config from SharedPreferences
5. Waits 1 second for connection stability
6. Sends configuration to device via BLE
7. Shows green success notification or orange failure warning

## Testing

### Test Bluetooth Monitoring:
1. Start app with Bluetooth off
2. Verify warning card and dialog appear
3. Turn on Bluetooth from settings or app button
4. Verify scanning starts automatically

### Test Configuration Sync:
1. Disconnect from BLE device
2. Go to Settings, configure phone number and interval
3. Save configuration (stored locally)
4. Connect to device from scan list
5. Verify "Configuration synced to device" notification appears

## Status
âœ… Fixed - Bluetooth state monitoring and auto-sync implemented
