# Smart Bike Tracker - Implementation Plan

## Project Overview
Smart Bike Tracker is a comprehensive anti-theft system combining ESP32 hardware with a Flutter mobile app. The system detects theft through motion sensors and IR presence detection, automatically sending SMS alerts with GPS coordinates when unauthorized movement is detected. It features dual-source GPS tracking (phone when BLE connected, SIM7070G when disconnected) and 24-hour battery operation.
